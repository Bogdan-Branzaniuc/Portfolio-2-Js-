 - lack of sleep and nutrition due to enthuziasm for developing
 
## Features that weren't implemented due to lack of time
 - gsap functions to animate the DOM elements in a relevant manner according to the loading of the page and async request to the api that was used

 - wikipedia api to replace the iframe that renders warnings if not errors to the console
 - better documentation
 - more debugging and testing
 - an innovative project layout and flow
